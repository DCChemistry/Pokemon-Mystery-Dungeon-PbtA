When you prevent harm to another character, **roll +Tough**.

**On a 7+**, you protect them okay, but youâ€™ll suffer some or all of the harm they were going to get.

**On a 10+** choose an extra:
- You suffer little harm (-1 harm).
- All impending danger is now focused on you.
- You inflict harm on the enemy.
- You hold the enemy back.
