You can entertain people so they feel joy and forget their troubles. Say what you do and roll +Cute if it’s pure performance or +Beautiful if you add a pinch of magic. On a 10+ the audience is transported and happy. Troubles and trauma are eased in their minds, for a good while. On a 7-9 pick one: the effect just lasts a little while, or the regular time but there’s a ruckus when you’re done.
