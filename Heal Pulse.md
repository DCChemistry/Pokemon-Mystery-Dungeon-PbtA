> Taken from Monster of the Week’s Divine’s Lay On Hands - also, using the game’s equivalent to +Weird instead of the original +Cool

Your touch can heal injury and disease. When you **lay your hands on someone hurt**, roll +Beautiful. On a 10+, heal 2 harm or an illness, plus they’re stabilized. On a 7-9, you can heal the harm or illness as on a 10+, but you take it into yourself. On a miss, your aura causes them extra harm.
