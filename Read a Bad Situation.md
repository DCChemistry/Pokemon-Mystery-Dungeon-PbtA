When you look around and read a bad situation, **roll +Clever**.

**On a 10+** hold 3, and **on a 7-9**, hold 1. One hold can be spent to ask the MC one of the following questions:
- What’s my best way in?
- What’s my best way out?
- Are there any dangers we haven’t noticed?
- What’s the biggest threat?
- What’s most vulnerable to me?
- What’s the best way to protect the victims? If you act on the answers, you get +1 ongoing while the information is relevant.
