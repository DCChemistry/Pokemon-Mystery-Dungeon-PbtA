You have the gift of being friendly and easy to chat to. When you **try to make a good impression on someone you just met**, roll +Cute. On a 10+ they treat you as a trustworthy and friendly acquaintance. On a 7-9 they open up more than usual but still regard you as a stranger. On a 6 or less, they think you’re playing them, and they’ll not trust you or your companions.
