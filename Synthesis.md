When you have taken harm, **you can heal yourself**. Roll +Beautiful. On a 10+, heal 2-harm and stabilise your injuries. On a 7-9, heal 1-harm and stabilise your injuries. On a miss, your injuries worsen.

Once per mystery, you may attempt to **keep going despite your injuries**. Roll +Cool. On a 10+, heal 2 harm and stabilize your wounds. On a 7-9 you may either stabilize or heal 1 harm. On a miss, it was worse than it looked: the Keeper may inflict a harm move on you, or make your wounds unstable.
