Once you have given them a reason, tell them what you want them to do and **roll +Cute**.
## For a normal person:
- **On a 10+**, then they’ll do it for the reason you gave them. If you asked too much, they’ll tell you the minimum it would take for them to do it (or if there’s no way they’d do it).
- **On a 7-9**, they’ll do it, but only if you do something for them right now to show that you mean it. If you asked too much, they’ll tell you what, if anything, it would take for them to do it.

**For another player Pokemon:**
- **On a 10+**, if they do what you ask they mark experience and get +1 forward.
- **On a 7-9**, they mark experience if they do what you ask. On a miss, it’s up to that hunter to decide how badly you offend or annoy them. They mark experience if they decide not to do what you asked. Monsters and minions cannot normally be manipulated.
