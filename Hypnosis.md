When you gaze into a Pokemon’s eyes and **exert your will over them**, roll +Cute. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. You may spend your hold to give them an order. Regular people will follow your order, whatever it is. Player Pokemon can choose whether they do it or not. If they do, they mark experience.
