When you touch someone, you can read their surface thoughts. Roll +Beautiful. On a 10+, ask 3. On a 7–9, ask 1:
- What is your character thinking about right now?
- Who are you protecting?
- Why are you keeping secrets?
- What is your character’s hidden pain?
On a miss, you inflict 1-harm ([[Armour Piercing|ap]]) on them and yourself.
